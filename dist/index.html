			<p>In my time since The Iron Yard and in between contracts, I've been working on little coding challenges on a couple of different websites. As the projects grew both in volume and intensity, I decided to start making these into small scale challenges-turned-projects. These challenges range from things like word counters for essays to fully functional sudoku puzzles.</p>
